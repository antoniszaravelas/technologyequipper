# TECHEQUIPPER

## Description

My motivation to build this E-Commerce website was that I was tempted to learn more about how specific MERN technologies work (NodeJS, Creating a server providing a PORT, using Mongoose to manipulate data, find Users, create Models, using express etc.) in relation to each-other and build a full-stack App!

Have a look in the deployed with Heroku version: [link to the e-commerce shop "techequipper"](https://techequipper.herokuapp.com/)
